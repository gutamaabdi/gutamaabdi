Computer Science (Cyber Security) graduate building **production-minded cloud and DevOps projects**, with a strong foundation in security, observability, and system behaviour.

My focus is on understanding how systems behave **after deployment** — how they are operated, monitored, secured, and recovered when things break.

## 🎯 Focus

I’m working towards a **junior DevOps / Platform / Cloud role**, bringing a security-first mindset shaped by hands-on SOC work.

I care about:
- Simplicity over over-engineering  
- Cost-aware, VM-first architectures  
- Logging, monitoring, and failure modes  
- Clear documentation and recovery paths  

---

## 🧠 Background

My academic background is in **Cyber Security**, where I built practical SOC labs focused on:
- Turning raw telemetry into actionable insight  
- Correlating host and network activity  
- Writing clear reports that others can act on quickly  

That experience heavily influences how I approach infrastructure and DevOps work — I think in terms of **visibility, blast radius, and evidence**, not just deployment.

## 🛠 Core Skills

### Cloud & DevOps
- Linux systems (Ubuntu)
- Azure infrastructure (VM-based architectures)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Nginx, HTTPS, reverse proxying
- PostgreSQL (persistence, backups, recovery)
- Disk usage monitoring and basic alerting
- Production documentation and runbooks

### Security & Observability
- SIEM fundamentals (Splunk)
- Host telemetry (Sysmon, Windows Security)
- On-host network telemetry (DNS Client, Windows Firewall)
- Detection logic and correlation
- MITRE ATT&CK-aligned analysis
- Clear, structured reporting

---

## 🚀 Projects

### Production-Minded Analytics Platform (Azure)
A small but realistic analytics platform built to behave like a live system.

**Key aspects:**
- VM-first design for clarity and cost control  
- Containerised application (Umami)  
- PostgreSQL with data persisted on a separate disk  
- Automated backups with retention  
- Disk-usage monitoring  
- Nginx front end secured with HTTPS  
- Documented recovery paths  

> Focus: learning how systems behave once they’re live, not just how to deploy them once.

---

### Azure SOC Detection Lab
End-to-end SOC lab simulating real analyst workflows.

**Highlights:**
- Log onboarding into Splunk  
- Host + network telemetry correlation  
- Process → DNS → egress analysis  
- Dashboards and MITRE-mapped detections  
- Analyst-ready reporting
